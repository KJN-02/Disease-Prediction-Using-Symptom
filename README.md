# Disease-Prediction-Using-Symptom
Disease Prediction Using Symptom Data

Overview

This project analyzes a medical dataset where diseases are associated with symptoms represented in binary form (0 for absent, 1 for present). The goal is to:

    -Explore and visualize symptom-disease patterns.
    
    -Train multiple classification models to predict diseases based on symptoms.
    
    -Implement a real-time disease prediction function based on user-input symptoms.
